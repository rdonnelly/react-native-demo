# react-native-demo

This project should serve as a small demo for React Native. It is not a starter or boilerplate, it is intended to be used as a walkthrough to show some of the cool things about React Native.

## How Do I Use This?

There are 7 stages that one can go through to get different levels of progress for the demo app. Run the project in an Android Emulator and iOS Simulator and check out the various tags to see different functionality.

#### Stage 1
  - `git checkout stage1`
  - base create-react-native app
  - get the app up and running on both platforms
#### Stage 2
  - `git checkout stage2`
  - add text and button to UI
  - show that adding UI is easy to add and update using React syntax
#### Stage 3
  - `git checkout stage3`
  - add counter to app component state
  - light interaction is easy
#### Stage 4
  - `git checkout stage4`
  - add react-navigation and tab interface
  - adding native UI components is easy, React Navigation is cool
#### Stage 5
  - `git checkout stage5`
  - add native ripple to button for Android
  - some things require platform-specific code, here's a trivial example
#### Stage 6
  - `git checkout stage6`
  - add a section list component to the second tab
  - list components are easy to work with and implement
#### Stage 7
  - `git checkout stage7`
  - restructure app and add redux for counter
  - pulling out business logic is easy, common/familiar patterns are good to go
